## Introduction

View synthesis has traditionally relied on extensive 3D data. Our model, LVSM, seeks to address the challenges faced in this area by employing a minimalistic 3D inductive bias. This enables the generation of realistic views even when provided with limited 3D information. This approach is vital for applications in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous driving.

### Motivation

The need for efficient view synthesis models is paramount in an era where 3D data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. Our work aims to bridge this gap, providing researchers and developers with robust tools to enhance their projects. 

## Installation

To get started with LVSM, follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zalkklop/LVSM.git
   cd LVSM
   ```

2. Install the necessary Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have the latest version of your deep learning framework installed (TensorFlow or PyTorch).

## Usage

To use LVSM, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py --config config.yaml
```

Make sure to modify the `config.yaml` file to suit your specific needs. 

## Features

- **Minimal 3D Inductive Bias:** Our model operates efficiently with reduced reliance on extensive 3D data.
- **High-Quality View Generation:** Generates realistic views suitable for various applications.
- **Modular Architecture:** The design allows easy integration and customization.
