## Introduction

View synthesis has traditionally relied on extensive 3D data. Our model, LVSM, seeks to address the challenges faced in this area by employing a minimalistic 3D inductive bias. This enables the generation of realistic views even when provided with limited 3D information. This approach is vital for applications in fields such as augmented reality, virtual reality, and autonomous driving.

### Motivation

The need for efficient view synthesis models is paramount in an era where 3D data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. Our work aims to bridge this gap, providing researchers and developers with robust tools to enhance their projects. 

## Installation

To get started with LVSM, follow these steps to install the required dependencies:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
