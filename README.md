## 0. Clarification

This is the **official repository** for the paper _"LVSM: A Large View Synthesis Model with Minimal 3D Inductive Bias"_.

The code here is a **re-implementation** and **differs** from the original version developed at Adobe. However, the provided checkpoints are from the original Adobe implementation and were trained inside Adobe.

We have verified that the re-implemented version matches the performance of the original. For any questions or issues, please contact Haian Jin at [haianjin0415@gmail.com](mailto:haianjin0415@gmail.com).

## 1. Preparation

### Environment
```
conda create -n LVSM python=3.11
conda activate LVSM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Data
Download the RealEstate10K dataset from [this link](http://schadenfreude.csail.mit.edu:8000/), which is provided by [pixelSplat](https://github.com/dcharatan/pixelsplat), and put the data in `YOUR_RAW_DATAPATH`.
Run the following command to preprocess the data into our format.
```bash
python preprocess_data.py --base_path YOUR_RAW_DATAPATH --output_dir YOUR_PROCESSED_DATAPATH --mode ['train' or 'test']
```

### Checkpoints
The scene-level evaluation is conducted on the [RealEstate10K](http://schadenfreude.csail.mit.edu:8000/) dataset.

| Model | PSNR  | SSIM  | LPIPS |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| [LVSM Decoder-Only Scene-Level res256 (full)](https://huggingface.co/coast01/LVSM/resolve/main/scene_decoder_only_256.pt?download=true) | 29.67 | 0.906 | 0.098 |
| [LVSM Encoder-Decoder Scene-Level res256 (full)](https://huggingface.co/coast01/LVSM/resolve/main/scene_encoder_decoder_256.pt?download=true) | 28.60 | 0.893 | 0.114 |

## 2. Training

Before training, you need to follow the instructions [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/public-api-guide/#:~:text=You%20can%20generate%20an%20API,in%20the%20upper%20right%20corner.) to generate the Wandb key file and save it in the `configs` folder as `api_keys.yaml`. You can use the `api_keys_example.yaml` as a template.

The original training command:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 --nnodes 8 \
    --rdzv_id 18635 --rdzv_backend c10d --rdzv_endpoint localhost:29502 \
    train.py --config configs/LVSM_scene_decoder_only.yaml
```
The training will be distributed across 8 GPUs and 8 nodes with a total batch size of 512.
`LVSM_scene_decoder_only.yaml` is the config file for the scene-level Decoder-Only LVSM model. You can also use `LVSM_scene_encoder_decoder.yaml` for the training of the scene-level Encoder-Decoder LVSM model.

If you have limited resources, you can use the following command to train a smaller model with a smaller batch size:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 --nnodes 1 \
    --rdzv_id 18635 --rdzv_backend c10d --rdzv_endpoint localhost:29502 \
    train.py --config configs/LVSM_scene_decoder_only.yaml \
    model.transformer.n_layer = 12 \
    training.batch_size_per_gpu = 16

```
Here, we decrease the total batch size from 512 to 128, and the transformer layers from 24 to 12. You can also increase the patch-size from 8 to 16 for faster training with lower performance. 
We have also discussed the efficient settings (single/two GPU training) in the paper.


## 3. Inference

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node 8 --nnodes 1 \
--rdzv_id 18635 --rdzv_backend c10d --rdzv_endpoint localhost:29506 \
inference.py --config "configs/LVSM_scene_decoder_only.yaml" \
training.dataset_path = "./preprocessed_data/test/full_list.txt" \
training.batch_size_per_gpu = 4 \
training.target_has_input =  false \
training.num_views = 5 \
training.square_crop = true \
training.num_input_views = 2 \
training.num_target_views = 3 \
inference.if_inference = true \
inference.compute_metrics = true \
inference.render_video = true \
inference_out_dir = ./experiments/evaluation/test
```
After the inference, the code will generate a html file in the `inference_out_dir` folder. You can open the html file to view the results.
